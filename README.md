This project was developed as part of a 5-member team, implementing a complete flight booking website with both frontend and backend features.

My Contribution

I was responsible for:

Designing and building the full frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Creating a user-friendly interface for:

Login

Flight search

Flight selection

Booking confirmation

Connecting the frontend with the backend API, ensuring:

Login & authentication works smoothly

Flight search results are dynamically fetched from the server

Selected flights are saved and displayed correctly

All pages communicate with the backend through fetch requests

Debugging and testing the full user flow from login → search → booking
